# Gaussian-Naive-Bayes-classifier-from-scratch-
To implement a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier from scratch to classify data using probabilistic reasoning.

Problem Statement

Given a dataset with multiple features and a target column, implement a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier that calculates prior probabilities and likelihood using Gaussian assumptions. The classifier should predict the class labels of test data and assess performance using standard metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
